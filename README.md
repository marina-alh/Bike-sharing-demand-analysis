This project analyzes how weather would affect bike-sharing demand in urban areas. It uses the Soul bike sharing demand data set.
My tasks include:

    Collecting and understanding data from multiple sources
    Performing data wrangling and preparation with regular expressions and Tidyverse
    Performing exploratory data analysis with SQL and visualization using Tidyverse and ggplot2
    Performing modelling the data with linear regressions using Tidymodels
